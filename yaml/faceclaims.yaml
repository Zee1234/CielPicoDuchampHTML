    Moderate height female. Her skin is a medium dark brown. Not black, certainly, though that would certainly be how many would describe it. Her eyes are a bright golden. Her hair is short, a very close shave, but the curliness it boasts is obvious even when so short. It is also a bright, baby blue. The woman's lips seem to be absolutely coated in makeup, the same color as her hair.

    Ciel has dark, purple-blue hair. It is quite thick and very good a fighting the forces of gravity. Ciel has let it grow out naturally to about as long as his head is tall, and does not let it grow much further. He has very prominent double eyelids, to the point where it looks like he is wearing makeup. Due to an incident in childhood (the one that left him with a broken nose), he has fat deposits under his eyes, making it appear as if he constantly has bags. Given that his face has no other signs of advanced aging, this makes him appear tired constantly. even if he is wide awake. This is only promoted by his frequently featureless face that seems to give no inkling of emotion, often giving off an aura of indifference or boredom. Standing at just over five feet nine inches. Combined with his hair, he reaches nearly six foot four. He has a wide frame, and long arms to go with it. While not ripped, his limbs are not stocky. With a middle of the road muscle mass, he appears, in many ways, to be remarkably average. He stands at 5'9 and weights 156 lbs.
