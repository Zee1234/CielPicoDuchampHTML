histories:
  Higashi:
    birthplace: Land of Fire
    long: |-
      Born on a small farmhouse, Higashi was a weak child. When they were born, barely a squeak escaped their mouth. Doctors feared for the young child, worried it would pass before its day. By the loving hand of their parents, however, the infant grew stronger. Still physically frail, at least they no longer treaded upon death's door.

      However, the child's extreme fraility rendered them useless for most farm work. They grew up limping around the farmhouse, using a large stick to help them stay aloft. It would not be until puberty that they could successfully stand completely unassisted, and even then they would tire quickly.

      It was a boring life, and they wished better for their parents. They wanted to help them. But they never got the chance. The child got terribly ill one day. The parents rushed them to the hospital, then refused to leave their side. The child survived, but the parents both caught the sickness. They had spent everything to keep their child alive, and despite her pleading, the small town doctor could not himself afford to help them for free. The medicine was expensive, and he barely scraped by in the rural area.

      The child say besides their parents at the time of death. There were less than two hours seperating them.

      The child lived with their aunt from that point on. The aunt was not mean, and was in fact rather accomodating, but she was intimidating. The child disliked their aunt, though whether that was genuine dislike or misplaced sorrow is not obvious. The child tried running away several times, but succombed to exhaustion each time.

      But they were improving. Getting farther. The townsfolk secretly believe the aunt was silently cheering the child on, even while berating them for running away and risking injury once again.

      The child did give up, eventually. They realized that the aunt truly did care, even if it was in a bit of an odd way. So the child took up a job at a small pub. They could make the journey there now, on a daily basis. It was true progress for them, and while they still could not do the heavy lifting the job sometimes required, at least they were growing stronger.

      Several more years passed before the child was finally able to leave the town. They had taken to long walks after work, slowly pushing their limits. Still far from the peak of physical fitness, the once-a-child could now go respectable distances.
  Duchamp:
    birthplace: Tengakure
    long: |-
      Born in the upper levels of a vertically sprawling medical building, Duchamp was the prototypical newborn. They cried when slapped. Cried when hungry. Cold. Hot. Wet. Dry. Poopy. Bored. Sometimes just because. Seriously. BABY.

      Perhaps you knew 'that' kid growing up. You know which one I'm talking. They would use a magnifying glass to burn ants and cut the tails off lizards to see if they would grow back. Perhaps you have guessed by now, but Duchamp was just one such child.

      Duchamp was a cruel child. They would bully their peers, but had a way with the adults. They could always talk themself out of trouble, and sometimes even get their victims to be punished. Perhaps the lack of a father figure saw to this, as their old man had left when the child was but three of age. Not left their mother, mind you, merely the village. He was a traveling man who still loved his wife. They married with the woman knowing full well that the man would one day embark to travel the world again, and she merely waited excitedly for his return.

      That is, until she got terribly sick. It was three years after the father had left. The parents had been exchanging letters, though it always took longer for the wife's to reach the husband, as she was never fully sure of where he would be. The father had been spending much time within the country of Haven at that point in history, and the letter from the doctors of his wife's state of health was able to find him somewhat quickly. Even such, it took him time to return, and by the time of his return, she had passed away. The man was broken, carrying on only by the thought of his children. Duchamp was already an... angry child, however, and a father they never thought they knew was not an authority figure to them. Duchamp caused their father much pain by acting out.

      Duchamp eventually grew angry *and* tired of their old man, so they decided to act with a touch of finality.

      Emotions flooded their mind. Duchamp wanted their father to be punished with something worse than death. Something truly terrible. He would lose his beloved child.  They would not die, no, but he would never be able to find the child. That was the plan. So Duchamp ran, carrying the mass, until giving it away to a couple.

      After this fateful day, Duchamp became an orphan. Not by loss of their father, but by their father's loss of them.  Duchamp began going by a fake name, and never spoke of their last name. Now they were a random. They had no skill with chakra. None. They were a homeless child living in a city off of scraps.

      Of course, they were not that hard off. They were a manipulative person. They would use pity and tricks to get money. They would use the money to buy food and water, and even use it to get older children, those within the ninja academy, to teach them. They could generally figure these things out. Even so, it took them over a decade to gain competency with what most to-be ninja had down pact by the age of twelve or thirteen. With their need to keep providing food and water for themself, they had little time to do more than the bare minimum of practice.

      Several years later, at the age of twenty two, they were part of a large group of people evacuated from their homes, transported across country borders, and left to rot within a massive underground complex. They did not like this place. The people were more cautious here, harder to con. It was simply unfun. So they left. There was very little effort put up to stop them. There were none that truly liked them, and leaving was only discouraged, not disallowed. Many called them a fool, saying that their departure was a death sentence, that their people were hated in the outside world. These statements were due in no small part to the recent knowledge that they had lost.

      Even so, they left. They would be on their own for some time to come. They would transfer between identities like a breath on the wind, but they would always return to calling themself by their first assumed name, or even their true name. They still liked that name, even if they had abandoned it long ago.
