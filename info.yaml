      Born in the upper levels of a vertically sprawling medical building, Ciel was the prototypical newborn. He cried when slapped. Cried when hungry. Cold. Hot. Wet. Dry. Poopy. Bored. Sometimes just because. Seriously. BABY.

      Perhaps you knew 'that' kid growing up. You know which one I'm talking. They would use a magnifying glass to burn ants and cut the tails off lizards to see if they would grow back. Perhaps you have guessed by now, but Ciel was just one such child.

      Ciel was a cruel child. He would bully his peers, but had a way with the adults. He could always talk himself out of trouble, and sometimes even get his victims to be punished. Perhaps the lack of a father figure saw to this, as his old man had left when the child was but three of age. Not left his mother, mind you, merely the village. He was a traveling man who still loved his wife. They married with the woman knowing full well that the man would one day embark to travel the world again, and she merely waited excitedly for his return.

      That is, until she got terribly sick. It was three years after the father had left. The parents had been exchanging letters, though it always took longer for the wife's to reach the husband, as she was never fully sure of where he would be. The father had been spending much time within the country of Haven at that point in history, and the letter from the doctors of his wife's state of health was able to find him somewhat quickly. Even such, it took him time to return, and by the time of his return, she had passed away. The man was broken, carrying on only by the thought of his children. Ciel was already an... angry child, however, and a father he never thought he knew was not an authority figure to him. Ciel caused his father much pain by acting out.

      Ciel eventually grew angry *and* tired of his old man, so he decided to act with a touch of finality. Ciel had been... skilled in certain aspects of his bloodline. He figured out the transformation technique of his clan, on his own, before most people of his clan would have been taught it. While he lacked in other aspects of his kekkai genkai, his proficiency within this one realm was without question.

      This proficiency led to something somewhat shocking. In a fit of anger, he managed to create a permanent transformation, one that could not simply be released. He was even able to enact this upon another person, though them being a hiyu and not knowing anything was changing went a long way to making it work. Unfortunately, Ciel had not actually devised this technique. He was working off or passion and instinct, and it proved less than perfect.

      Emotions flooded his mind. Ciel wanted his father to be punished with something worse than death. Something truly terrible. He would lose his beloved child.  They would not die, no, but he would never be able to identify the child. That was the plan. Bright, vibrant hair dulled. It darkened, and gained a tint of blue. Upon Ciel's own hair, the blue mixed with more until it was the navyish blue-purple that he sports now. At the same time, the the folicles and other groups of cells responsible for creating the hair altered, permanently making this the new hair color. The eyes changed from a brilliant, bright baby blue into a dark shade that refused to be pinned to only one color. Ciel's settled on their current color mere moments later. Small but noticable changes also occured to face structure, such as Ciel's double eyelids and the bags under his eyes. Even skin tone was changed. All of these changes were based on people Ciel had seen while running away.

      Since that one fateful day, Ciel has been unable to determine how he enacted these changes. His recognition and consciencousnes of the flow of chakra within himself was limited back then. He could not remember how he did it, what 'buttons' he pushed. He has idly toyed with the idea since this event, but with access to a 'normal' transformation, he does not see terribly much use for it, so it is nothing more than something to tackle when bored.

      After this fateful day, Ciel became an orphan. Not by loss of his father, but by his father's loss of him.  Ciel began going by the name "Pico", and never spoke of his last name. Pico was a random. They had no skill with chakra. None. They were a homeless child living in a city off of scraps.

      Of course, Pico was not that hard off. He was a manipulative person. He would use pity and tricks to get money. He would use the money to buy food and water, and even use it to get older children, those within the ninja academy, to teach him. He could generally figure these things out. Even so, it took him over a decade to gain competency with what most to-be ninja had down pact by the age of twelve or thirteen. With his need to keep providing food and water for himself, he had little time to do more than the bare minimum of practice.

      Several years later, at the age of twenty two, he was part of a large group of people evacuated from their homes, transported across country borders, and left to rot within a massive underground complex. Pico did not like this place. The people were more cautious here, harder to con. It was simply unfun. So he left. There was very little effort put up to stop him. There were none that truly liked him, and leaving was only discouraged, not disallowed. Many called him a fool, saying that his departure was a death sentence, that their people were hated in the outside world. These statements were in no small part to the recent knowledge that they had lost.

      Even so, Pico left. He would be on his own for some time to come. He would transfer between identities like a breath on the wind, but he would always return to calling himself either Pico or Ciel. He still liked that name, even if he had abandoned it long ago.
